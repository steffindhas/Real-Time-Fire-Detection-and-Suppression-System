# Real-Time-Fire-Detection-and-Suppression-System
This fire detection and suppression system is a smart and fast way to stop fires before they spread. It uses a camera and artificial intelligence to quickly spot fire and turn on a system to put it out right away. Unlike older systems that only detect smoke or heat, this one sees fire with more accuracy and fewer false alarms. It works well in homes, offices, factories, and public places. The system is affordable, easy to use, and helps keep people and property safe by acting quickly in case of fire.
